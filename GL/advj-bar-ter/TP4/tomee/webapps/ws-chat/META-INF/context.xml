Attribut reloadable
Set to true if you want Catalina to monitor classes in /WEB-INF/classes/ and /WEB-INF/lib for changes,
and automatically reload the web application if a change is detected. This feature is very useful during
application development, but it requires significant runtime overhead and is not recommended for use on
deployed production applications. That's why the default setting for this attribute is false.
You can use the Manager  web application, however, to trigger reloads of deployed applications on demand.
